# Calculator

This is a project built as my final project for [The Odin Project's Foundations path](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). In it, I use the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills that I acquired throughout the course's lessons to build a basic calculator that supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.
